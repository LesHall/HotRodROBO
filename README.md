Files related to the hot rodding of my ROBO 3D printer.  

These files are from a collection of various applications all playing a role
in the hot rodding of my ROBO 3D printer.  I am redesigning the entire system except
for the chassis, rods, and motors.  This means all new electronics of a distributed 
multiprocessor nature, an audio control system, and wireframe print.  Files include:

FM3D.ck - ChucK program for driving test audio to the processors.  

FM3D.ino - Arduino code for the stepper motors

StepperDriver.sch - EAGLE CAD schematic of stepper motor driver
